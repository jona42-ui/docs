## Setup your development

Learn how to configure your environment for the Google Bookings API integration and deploy it.

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup> <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your project repository"> Begin by cloning the repository where your Google Bookings API integration code is stored. You can find your repository on your version control platform (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). To clone the repository locally, follow these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) in your terminal: ```bash git clone <repository-url> ``` After cloning, ensure that your environment is properly configured to run the project locally. </Accordion> <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview and test your integration"> Before pushing your code to production, you should test it locally to ensure that your booking functionalities work as expected. 1. Install the necessary dependencies (e.g., Node.js, npm) by running: ```bash npm install ``` 2. Use the sandbox environment provided by Google for testing your API calls. Update your environment variables to point to the sandbox environment. 3. Run the server locally to preview changes: ```bash npm run dev ``` </Accordion> </AccordionGroup>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup> <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Set up Google Cloud API and Actions Center"> To integrate with Google Bookings, you need to set up Google Cloud APIs and the Google Actions Center. Ensure that you have enabled the **Bookings API** and configured the necessary OAuth credentials. Follow the official [Google Cloud setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/enable-disable-apis). In addition, register and configure your booking server in the Google Actions Center to handle bookings in real time. </Accordion> <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes and test"> Once you've tested locally, commit and push your changes to your Git repository: ```bash git add . git commit -m "Google Bookings API integration" git push origin main ``` Test the deployment in a production-like environment to verify booking flows with real-time API interactions. </Accordion> </AccordionGroup>
